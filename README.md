## 🚀 How It Works

### Data Flow
- Book content is loaded from a local `books.json` file (self-contained, no external API dependency)
- Each book has its own theme, pricing, and reviews
- Content updates instantly when switching between books
- Last viewed book is saved to localStorage for persistent user experience

### Data Architecture
The project uses a simple but effective data structure:
```json
{
  "books": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Book Title",
      "description": "...",
      "priceCards": { ... },
      "reviews": [ ... ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dynamic Content Updates
When a user selects a book, the `showBook()` function updates:
- Page title and favicon
- Hero section content
- Pricing information
- About section details
- Customer reviews
- Overall color theme

### Form Validation
Custom validation rules ensure data quality:
- Name: 2-40 letters only
- Email: Valid email format
- Location: Valid address format
- Format selection: Required field
